# Agentic Applications for Unified Data Foundation

<br/>
This solution accelerator empowers organizations to make faster, smarter decisions at scale by leveraging agentic AI solutions built on a unified data foundation with Microsoft Fabric. With seamless integration of Microsoft Foundry agents and Agent Framework orchestration, teams can design intelligent workflows that automate routine processes, streamline operations, and enable natural language querying across enterprise datasets. This ensures that governed, high-quality data is accessible not only to technical specialists but also to business users, creating a shared environment where insights are surfaced more easily and decisions are grounded in trusted information. By unifying data access and applying AI in the flow of work, organizations gain the agility to respond rapidly to changing business needs, foster collaboration across teams, and drive innovation with greater confidence.

 <br/>To ensure sufficient quota is available in your subscription, please follow [quota check instructions guide](./documents/QuotaCheck.md) before you deploy the solution.

## Guidance

### Prerequisites and costs
To deploy this solution accelerator, ensure you have access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with the necessary permissions to create **resource groups, resources, app registrations, and assign roles at the resource group level**. This should include Contributor role at the subscription level and  Role Based Access Control role on the subscription and/or resource group level. Follow the steps in [Azure Account Set Up](./documents/AzureAccountSetUp.md). You will also need to have a minimum of an F2 Fabric capacity. Follow the steps in [Fabric Capacity Set Up](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/admin/capacity-settings?tabs=fabric-capacity#create-a-new-capacity).

Here are some example regions where the services are available: East US, East US2, Australia East, UK South, France Central.

Check the [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=all&regions=all) page and select a **region** where the following services are available.

Pricing varies by region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage. The majority of Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers. However, some services—such as Azure Container Registry, which has a fixed cost per registry per day, and others like Cosmos DB or SQL Database when provisioned—may incur baseline charges regardless of actual usage.

Use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator) and the [Fabric Capacity Estimator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-fabric/capacity-estimator) to calculate the cost of this solution in your subscription. 

Review a [sample pricing sheet](https://azure.com/e/708895d4fc4449b1826016fad8a83fe0) in the event you want to customize and scale usage.

_Note: This is not meant to outline all costs as selected SKUs, scaled use, customizations, and integrations into your own tenant can affect the total consumption of this sample solution. The sample pricing sheet is meant to give you a starting point to customize the estimate for your specific needs._

The sample data illustrates how this accelerator could be used for an sales analyst scenario across industries. 
In this scenario, an organization is in the process of analyzing top performing products for sales research. Previously, the sales analyst had to sift through disparate sales and customer data across data silos. Leveraging the solution accelerator, the analyst now has access to unified data in Microsoft Fabric enabling a holistic view of customer and sales performance data. This functionality allows for the analyst to interrogate the data (e.g. "which customer segments show strongest year-over-year revenue growth", "what are my top performance products by demographic").


⚠️ The sample data used in this repository is synthetic and generated. The data is intended for use as sample data only.

### Security guidelines

This solution uses [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for secure access to Azure resources during local development and production deployment, eliminating the need for hard-coded credentials.

To maintain strong security practices, it is recommended that GitHub repositories built on this solution enable [GitHub secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) to detect accidental secret exposure.

Additional security considerations include:

- Enabling [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud) to monitor and secure Azure resources.
- Using [Virtual Networks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli) or [firewall rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) to protect Azure Container Apps from unauthorized access.
